## Introduction to Machine Learning
*Lesson Outline*

#### Machine learning is creating rapid and exciting changes across all levels of society.

* It is the engine behind the recent advancements in industries such as autonomous vehicles.
* It allows for more accurate and rapid translation of the text into hundreds of languages.
* It powers the AI assistants you might find in your home.
* It can help improve worker safety.
* It can speed up drug design.

#### This lesson is divided into the following sections:

* First, we’ll discuss what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved in creating a machine learning project.
* Next, we’ll step into the shoes of a machine learning practitioner. Machine learning involves using trained models to generate predictions and detect patterns from data. To understand the process, we’ll break down the different steps involved and examine a common process that applies to the majority of machine learning projects.
* Finally, we’ll take you through three examples using the steps we described to solve real-life scenarios that might be faced by machine learning practitioners.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of the Introduction to machine learning section, you will be able to do the following. Take a moment to read through these, checking off each item as you go through them.
 * Differentiate between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
 * Identify problems that can be solved with machine learning.
 * Describe commonly used algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means.
 * Describe how model training and testing works.
 * Evaluate the performance of a machine learning model using metrics.
